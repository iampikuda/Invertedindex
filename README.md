## What Is Inverted index?

- An inverted index (also referred to as postings file or inverted file) is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a database file, or in a document or a set of documents (named in contrast to a Forward Index, which maps from documents to content). The purpose of an inverted index is to allow fast full text searches, at a cost of increased processing when a document is added to the database. The inverted file may be the database file itself, rather than its index.

### Features

- Users are able to click an 'Upload File to upload book files which also allow multiple uploads.

- Users are able to click a 'Create Index button to create an Index based on data in uploaded files.

- Users are able to search through files that have been indexed which enables:
 - *Searching through selected files*,
 - *Search through all indexed files*
 - *Users will be able to view the result of indexed files and searched words in a tabular format showing*:

      - Title of books
      - Number of word occurrences in each book if word is found
      - A found or not found icon depending on if the word is found


## Why the project is useful
- An Inverted Index is an Index Data Structure storing a mapping from content to location (i.e. a mapping of words or numbers to it's location in a database file).

- Inverted index makes it easy to search contents of a file, especially when there a more than one files included.
